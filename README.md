# Construction-Equipment-Detector-for-Safety-Measurements

Overview
A computer vision-based safety monitoring system designed to detect and verify the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) on construction sites. This project uses advanced machine learning models to identify essential safety gear including hard hats, safety helmets, high-visibility vests, safety gloves, steel-toed boots, safety goggles, ear protection, and harnesses in real-time from camera feeds or uploaded images. The system automatically alerts supervisors when workers are detected in hazardous areas without proper PPE, maintains compliance records for safety audits, and provides comprehensive analytics on safety protocol adherence. Built with Python, OpenCV, and deep learning frameworks like YOLO or R-CNN, the detector helps construction companies reduce workplace accidents, ensure regulatory compliance, and create safer work environments by continuously monitoring PPE usage across multiple job sites simultaneously through an intuitive web-based dashboard interface.
